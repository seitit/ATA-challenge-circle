# ATA-challenge-circle


Solution to a challenge for a thinking ape from the vanhackthon event.

Challenge:
Imagine you have a circle of people and you go around the circle removing every second person until one person is left.

If you have 3 people in the circle, then the 3rd person will be the last one remaining.
If you have 4 people then the 1st person will be the last one remaining.
If you have 11 people then the 7th person will be the one remaining.

If you have N people in the circle, who will be the last one remaining?

Please formulate your answer as a general solution and not as an algorithm that simulates the problem.
