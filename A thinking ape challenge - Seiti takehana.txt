Imagine you have a circle of people and you go around the circle removing every second person until one person is left.

If you have 3 people in the circle, then the 3rd person will be the last one remaining.
If you have 4 people then the 1st person will be the last one remaining.
If you have 11 people then the 7th person will be the one remaining.

If you have N people in the circle, who will be the last one remaining?

Please formulate your answer as a general solution and not as an algorithm that simulates the problem.


n   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
P(n)| 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 1 | 3 |  5 |  7 |  9 |

The first thing to notice here is that never an even number will be the last one because the first trip through the circle
eliminates the even numbers. and all numbers that are power of 2 the last number remaining will always be 1. They are
grouped by power of 2.


Assume we start with 2n people, the first trip through eliminates even numbers, the left is a set of odd numbers.

If we assume the set remaining is even:

j(2n) = 2*j(n) - 1  

If we assume the set is odd:

j(2n+1) = 2*j(n) + 1

the general theorem is

j(2^p + r) = 2r + 1, where p >= 0 and 0<= r < 2^p, e^p is the largest power of two
that are less or equals n and r are the remainder to complete n

basis case: 
assume n = 1
j(1) = j(2^p + r)

j(2^0 + 0) 

j(0)

now we replace j(0) with the odd formula 2*j(n) + 1

2*0 + 1 = 1
  
know that the basis case is proved we make the induction steps for even and odd
separetely

even case

2n = 2^p + r

j(2^p+r) = 2j(n) - 1               

= 2j((2^p+r)/2) - 1

= 2j(2^(p-1) + r/2) - 1

in order to go to next step i do another induction

j(2^p + r) = 2r + 1

n = p - 1 and k = r/2

j(2^n + k) = 2k + 1

= 2k/2 + 1

returning i've got

= 2(2r/2 + 1) - 1
 
= 2r + 1

so for even numbers that's the proof


for odd numbers 2^p + r = 2r + 1

j(2^p + r) = 2j(n) + 1

= 2j(2^(p-1) + (r-1)/2) + 1

as the even we need another step of induction

j(2^p + r) = 2r + 1

n = p - 1 and k = (r-1)/2

j(2^n + k) = 2k + 1

= 2(k-1)/2 + 1

= k-1+1

returning

= 2(r-1+1) + 1 

= 2r -2 + 2 + 1

= 2r + 1

that's the end of the proof by induction for odd numbers
